AI can make our lives a lot better in many ways. In healthcare, AI helps doctors find diseases faster and more accurately. In schools, AI can create personalized lessons for students, making learning easier. In transportation, self-driving cars and smart traffic systems can reduce accidents and make travel smoother. But AI also has some risks. It can take over jobs, leaving people unemployed. AI systems can be biased, which means they might treat some people unfairly. For example, an AI used in hiring might favor certain candidates over others. There are also cybersecurity threats, as AI can be used to create more advanced cyber attacks. So, while AI has lots of benefits, we need to be careful about how we use it.
